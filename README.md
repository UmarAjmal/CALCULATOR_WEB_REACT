# 🚀 React Calculator App | 💻✨

A simple yet functional calculator app built using React.js!

## 🔧 Key Features:

- 🧩 **Modular Component Structure:** UI is divided into reusable components for better maintainability and scalability.
- 🔁 **Used map() Function:** Calculator buttons are dynamically rendered using `.map()` to keep the code DRY and efficient.
- 📦 **Props & Multi-level Children:** Data and handlers are passed as props to multiple child components, showcasing component communication.
- 🎨 **Custom CSS Styling:** Designed with a clean and responsive layout using custom CSS modules (no UI frameworks used).
- 📱 **Fully responsive** for mobile and desktop devices.

## 🧠 This project helped reinforce my concepts of:

- Component-based architecture
- React props & state
- Functional components
- Dynamic rendering using arrays
- Basic CSS styling & layout techniques
